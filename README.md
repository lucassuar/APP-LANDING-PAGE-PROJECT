to market it in one-page with diferent section that will form the entire layout and will act as pages.

The elements used are the following:

do with pages.

* Examples section: It is meant to be a showcase of diferent parts of an app that can be build.

* pricing section: Straigh forward, simple and easy-to-understand pricing model for all types of customers. 
Also included a fremiun plan that will convert a 5% (for example) of those subscribers.
