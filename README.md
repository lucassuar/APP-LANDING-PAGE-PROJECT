** APP LANDING PAGE PROJECT **

- Almetric is a custom app builder service for iOS & Android platform. Any type of business can have a custom 
and mantain mobile apps in a fraction of the time and cost.

------- UX ---------

- The main objective of the website is to briefly showcase the service and convert visitors into potential leads.

- The target pubic is small and medium business owners and decision makers of business that they dont have an app yet.
This potential prospects can get into the website an get atrated by the benefits and graphical appearance and hopefully
transition to become a customer.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

------ Features --------

My project consist of a single page website to allow for easy access to information for the user. As its a simple service I decided 
to market it in one-page with diferent section that will form the entire layout and will act as pages.

The elements used are the following:

1- NavBar: its a responsive bar that allow the user to quickly navigate to anywhere on the site as the would normally 
do with pages.

2- Header: Its meant to grab attention with colorful background and a short and direct sales-pitch lines and a app showcase.

3- Features/benefits section: The main three benefits that the potential customer can gain by subscribing to the service.

4- Examples section: It is meant to be a showcase of diferent parts of an app that can be build.

5- pricing section: Straigh forward, simple and easy-to-understand pricing model for all types of customers. 
Also included a fremiun plan that will convert a 5% (for example) of those subscribers.

6- Contact section: the objective of this section is to convert as many prospects as posible, that why is easy to spot with their CTA.

7- Footer: simple footer that encourge people to stay connected by email for future nurturing campaigns.


In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:
